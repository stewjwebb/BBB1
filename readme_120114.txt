Tony for your demo tomorrow a few notes:

When using dc voltage, 6V battery pack on the detector side (input) and 3.3V on the BBB (output) side.
The breadboard rail nearest the red line (there's red and blue) takes the positive voltage/red wire.
The breadboard rail nearest the blue line takes the ground or black wire.
THis is true on both the input and output side fo the HCPL-3700 chip.

I've used orange wire for 3.3V supply from BBB which comes out of header P9_3.
I've used yellow wire for the GND from BBB which comes out of the header P8_1.


The following GPIO pins are used as inputs to detect the output of the circuit:

030, P9_11, LO, 793, 1417495362.733570, HI, 637, 1417495641.440232;
048, P9_15, LO, 813, 1417495362.739061, HI, 605, 1417495641.445552;
060, P9_12, LO, 812, 1417495362.741640, HI, 606, 1417495641.448110;
061, P8_26, LO, 773, 1417495362.744243, HI, 391, 1417495641.450785;
067, P8_08, LO, 823, 1417495362.749450, HI, 595, 1417495641.455718;
068, P8_10, LO, 778, 1417495362.752622, HI, 421, 1417495641.458279;
069, P8_09, LO, 792, 1417495362.754532, HI, 421, 1417495641.461153;


Connect the output from the HCPL-3700 pin 7 to the corresponding GPIO input on the BBB. 

If you have the AC side of the chip facing you pin 1 is on the left by the divet. 
Pin 8 is opposite that on the far side. Pin 7 is next to pin 8. Numbered as below:

 AC  1 8 VCC
 DC+ 2 7 UNCONNECTED
 DC- 3 6 VO 
 AC  4 5 GND


The AC inputs are all 4.7KOhm 1/2W resistors

The DC inputs are 100 Ohm that's one hundred.

Before applying AC input, you should remove the input DC circuitry (my test stuff), these are the blue wires attached between the blue rail and pin 3 and the 100 Ohm resistors attached between pin2 and the red rail.

You should replace the green wire on the AC input side with your detectors.
This is assuming all of your detectors are two pin open/close switches.

Hope this helps.
